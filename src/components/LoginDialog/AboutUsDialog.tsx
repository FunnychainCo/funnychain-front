                        Significant hurdles prevent cryptocurrency mass adoption (volatility, scalability, time and education). We believe that with Funnychain, by having fun looking at memes, people will be using a decentralized application (with no central authority) and earn cryptocurrencies using it.<br />
                        A meme dApp where people gets rewarded in crypto without having to buy it first is the best way to bring crypto mass adoption.<br />
                        Funnychain allows users to view and share the funniest-rated memes with their friends, workplace, and the community. The platform incentivizes users for creating, curating, sharing memes, and especially rewards community founders/admins. Users can also bet on their favorite memes in cryptocurrencies, chat with friends using their favorite memes and share with their own community.<br />
                        <br />
